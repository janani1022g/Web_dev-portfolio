<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Janani G.K 👩‍💻, a driven and adaptable Computer Science graduate 🎓 with a keen interest in building practical, user-focused applications. My technical foundation lies in Python 🐍, SQL 🗄️, and Full Stack Development 🌐, which I've applied in real-world projects and professional environments. During my academic journey, I created a Hospital Management System 🏥 to streamline hospital operations and a Career Guidance Chatbot 🤖 designed to assist students in making informed decisions about their futures. Both projects deepened my expertise in backend logic 🔄, database integration 📊, and intuitive UI development 🎨.</p>

<p>Further expanding my industry exposure, I interned at TEKsystems Global Services 🏢 as a Project Trainee in the Data Modernization practice 📈, where I collaborated on data-driven solutions and sharpened my ability to adapt quickly to new tools and processes.In addition to my technical skills, I have a deep interest in languages and cross-cultural learning. I successfully completed Japanese Language Proficiency at both N5 and N4 levels 🏅, which has enhanced my communication skills and opened up opportunities to engage with Japanese language projects and communities.</p>

<p>I take pride in my continuous learning mindset 📚 and look forward to exploring opportunities where I can combine my technical knowledge with creative problem-solving 💡 to deliver meaningful solutions.</p>
